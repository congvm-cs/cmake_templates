## CMake Examples for Reference

## 1. Goals
In this project, I would like to learn and build an C/C++ app from a scratch with CMake.

As a newbie in C/C++, I spend a lot of time to research and implement some methods to deeply understand how C/C++ works.

Then I learn how to use CMake to automatically generate Makefile as a recipe to compile my project.

This documentation/project can be a reference for other C/C++ tasks.
