# CMake Examples for Reference
Author: congvm


## Getting Started
In this project, I would like to learn and build an C/C++ app from a scratch with CMake.

As a newbie in C/C++, I spend a lot of time to research and implement some methods to deeply understand how C/C++ works.

Then I learn how to use CMake to automatically generate Makefile as a recipe to compile my project.

This documentation/project can be a reference for other C/C++ tasks. 

## Prerequisites
To re-run my examples, you need to install some below libraries/tools:
1. [cmake](https://cgold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-step/installation.html)
2. [C/C++ compiler](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-g-the-c-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux)
